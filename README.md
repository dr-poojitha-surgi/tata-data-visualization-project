# Tata Data Visualization Project
## Project Overview
This repository contains the Tableau-based data analysis and visualization project developed for an online retail business during the Tata Data Visualization Virtual Micro-Internship with Forage. The primary goal of this project is to generate actionable insights to assist the CEO and CMO in evaluating business performance and making informed decisions for expansion.

The analysis focuses on both operational and marketing perspectives by exploring sales seasonality, customer segmentation, revenue contributions, and key business metrics. These insights help identify what is driving the business success and guide strategic planning for growth.

## Key Features
### Seasonality & Revenue Analysis:
Identification of months generating the highest revenue, analyzing predictable sales patterns to align marketing and inventory strategies.

### Customer Segmentation:
Categorization of customers by purchasing behavior and revenue contribution, distinguishing between frequent low-value buyers and infrequent high-value customers.

### Operational and Marketing Metrics:
Visualization of essential KPIs necessary for tracking performance and planning business expansion.

## Data Cleanup and Integrity
Prior to visualization, the raw dataset was cleaned directly within Tableau by:

Excluding records where Quantity is below 1 unit (to remove returns or errors)

Excluding records where Unit Price is below $0 (to remove invalid price entries)

## Interactive Dashboards
All findings are presented through intuitive Tableau dashboards designed for executive-level review and decision-making.
